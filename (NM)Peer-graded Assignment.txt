Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
SELECT count(*) FROM attribute

ii. Business table = 10000
SELECT count(*) FROM business

iii. Category table =10000
SELECT count(*) FROM category

iv. Checkin table =10000
SELECT count(*) FROM checkin

v. elite_years table =10000
SELECT count(*) FROM elite_years

vi. friend table = 10000
SELECT count(*) FROM friend

vii. hours table =10000
SELECT count(*) FROM hours

viii. photo table = 10000
SELECT count(*) FROM photo

ix. review table = 10000
SELECT count(*) FROM review

x. tip table = 10000
SELECT count(*) FROM tip

xi. user table =10000
SELECT count(*) FROM user

	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
SELECT count(distinct id) FROM business

ii. Hours =1562 (business_id)
SELECT count(distinct business_id) FROM hours

iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
SELECT count(distinct business_id) FROM category

iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
SELECT count(distinct business_id) FROM attribute

v. Review = 10000 (id), 8090 (business_id), 9581 (user_id)
SELECT count(distinct id), count(distinct business_id), count(distinct user_id) FROM review

vi. Checkin =  493 (business_id)
SELECT count(distinct business_id) FROM checkin

vii. Photo =10000 (id), 6493 (business_id)
SELECT count(distinct id), count(distinct business_id) FROM photo

viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id), 537 (user_id)
SELECT count(distinct business_id), count(distinct user_id) FROM tip

ix. User = 10000 (id)
SELECT count(distinct id) FROM user
x. Friend =  11 (user_id)
SELECT count(distinct user_id) FROM friend

xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)
SELECT count(distinct user_id) FROM elite_years


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM user
	WHERE id IS NULL ;

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:	3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:	3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg:	0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:	1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg:	24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	The number of fans in data set indicates is no correlation between review count and number of fans.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: More reviews with love
		hate = 232
		love = 1780

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT COUNT(*) 
	FROM (SELECT *
  		FROM review 
		WHERE text  = 'hate');

	
	SELECT COUNT(*) 
	FROM (SELECT *
  		FROM review 
		WHERE text = 'love');
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
No.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
The location data is inconclusive   with rating of business.

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT *
FROM business 
WHERE CITY = 'Vegas'
GROUP BY stars
ORDER BY stars DESC ;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
   Type of business (refer name)      
         
ii. Difference 2:
   Location (refer city)    
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT 
name
,city
,stars
,review_count
,is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY stars DESC ;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   What makes business have a high stars rating.       
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    I choose a queries that may effect to the stars rating business such as city,category,and the business is open or not.
Then I use LEFT JOIN to join data in business table with category table to show stars rating.                     
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
